NAME
    Module::Install::AssertOS - A Module::Install extension to require that
    we are running on a particular OS

SYNOPSIS
      # In Makefile.PL

      use inc::Module::Install;
      assertos qw(Linux FreeBSD Cygwin);

    The Makefile.PL will die unless the platform the code is running on is
    Linux, FreeBSD or Cygwin.

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Install::AssertOS is a Module::Install extension that integrates
    Devel::AssertOS so that CPAN authors may easily stipulate which
    particular OS environments their distributions may be built and
    installed on.

    The author specifies which OS or OS families are supported. The
    necessary Devel::AssertOS files are copied to the "inc/" directory along
    with the Module::Install files.

    On the module user side, the bundled "inc/" Devel::AssertOS determines
    whether the current environment is supported or not and will die
    accordingly.

COMMANDS
    This plugin adds the following Module::Install command:

    "assertos"
        Requires a list of OS or OS families that you wish to support. Check
        with Devel::CheckOS and Devel::CheckOS::Families for more details of
        what you may specify.
